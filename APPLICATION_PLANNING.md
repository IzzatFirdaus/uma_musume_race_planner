# VERSION 6 ‚Äî Frontend Redesign Milestone (2025-09-02)

Status: In-progress ‚Äî major UI overhaul, accessibility, and component refactors implemented; documentation updated.

Overview:
- Goal: Redesign UI to match Uma Musume style (no direct copyright), maximize engagement and accessibility.
- Key focuses: "M PLUS Rounded 1c" font, pastel stat palette, pill-shaped buttons/tabs, card-based dashboard/plan list, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, WCAG AA contrast.

Completed/implemented so far:
- Created: `css/theme_v6.css` (font import, stat palette, card/pill styles).
- Updated: `index.php` (theme link), `components/plan-list.php`, `x-stat-bar.php`, `x-skill-card.php`, `x-card.php`, `plan_details_modal.php`, `plan-inline-details.php`.
- Card-based dashboard and plan list: responsive grid, soft shadows, emoji headers.
- Accessibility: ARIA attributes, visible focus, keyboard navigation, WCAG AA contrast.
- Component refactors:
	- `x-stat-bar.php`: stat color via CSS variable, emoji icon, animated fill.
	- `x-skill-card.php`: pastel card, colored border by skill tag, pill action button.
	- `x-plan-card.php`: plan card with emoji, badges, summary strip, pill Open button.
	- `plan-list.php`: replaced table with card grid, pill filters, accessible tablist.
	- `plan_details_modal.php` & `plan-inline-details.php`: emoji title, summary strip, pill footer buttons.

Next steps / backlog:
- JS lint/test: run linters and unit tests (requires fixing `package.json` / installing Node deps) ‚Äî optional but recommended.
- Performance: If skill reference grows large, switch autosuggest to server-side incremental queries.
- UX polish: add tooltips, per-stat slider color segments, and keyboard shortcut improvements.
- Accessibility audit (Lighthouse), Playwright UI tests.

Validation checklist:
- [x] Theme and font applied globally
- [x] Card/pill UI in dashboard and plan list
- [x] Accessibility improvements (ARIA, keyboard, contrast)
- [x] Component refactors (stat bar, skill card, plan card)
- [x] No PHP/JS errors in updated files
- [x] Smoke test output matches new card/pill UI

Notes:
- All changes tracked in SPEC-05-UMA-MUSUME-UI-DESIGN and referenced in README and docs/components.md.
- Progressive enhancement: features fail gracefully if JS or Chart.js is unavailable.

## UMA MUSUME RACE PLANNER: Iterative UI Planning ‚Äì Official Game Style Alignment (VERSION 8)

This section defines the next UX/UI milestone to align the app‚Äôs visuals and interactions more closely with the official game‚Äôs look and feel while maintaining originality and accessibility.

### 1. Visual Style Inspiration (Screenshots Referenced)

- Use a predominantly white base (~70%), green main (~25%), and orange/pink accent (~5%) for a polished, game-like appearance.
- UI color schemes dynamically adapt to match each Uma Musume‚Äôs motif, reflecting character personalization.
- Text elements use gradients, outlines, and glowing effects for "NEW" badges and special emphasis.
- Stat bars and badges leverage iconic colors: blue for Speed, green for Stamina, red for Power, orange for Guts, purple for Wit.

### 2. Layout & Structure

- Header/Footer: Persistent info (current turn, goals, energy) in a fixed header; actionable elements (skip, menu) in a thumb-friendly footer.
- Main Content: Rigid placement of primary info (stats, buttons, dialog) for consistency across screens.
- Cards & Dialogs: Consistent vertical sizing, drop shadow, rounded corners. Buttons use white-to-green gradients and subtle shadows.
- Menu/Sidebar: Use icon-labeled navigation with clear grouping and sectioning.

### 3. Interaction & Feedback

- Tap and button feedback use horseshoe/star/colored dot animations to distinguish interaction types.
- Navigation icons and actionable elements include continuous animation for feedback and UI liveliness.
- Scene and lighting colors adapt to time, weather, and location for context awareness.
- Stat and energy bars animate smoothly on change; respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### 4. Typography

- Use "M PLUS Rounded 1c" from Google Fonts for main UI font, supporting Japanese text where needed; fallback to "Figtree" or system sans-serif.
- Text layouts prioritize readable line breaks and allow dynamic breaking for names as appropriate.

### 5. Component Blueprints

- Stat Bar: Colored, gradient progress bar with stat icon and bold label.
- Button: Large, pill-shaped with drop shadow, icon/emoji label.
- Skill Card: Colored border/tag for rarity/type, game-style layout.
- Plan Card: Mimic race/training card with left-aligned stats and right-aligned goals.
- Dialog: Two vertical size variants, drop shadow, consistent padding.
- Menu/Sidebar: Large icons, grouped sections, pastel backgrounds.

### 6. Responsive & Accessibility

- Mobile-first grid: main actions and navigation within thumb reach.
- All touch targets ‚â• 44px.
- WCAG AA contrast for text/backgrounds.
- Keyboard navigation and ARIA labels for modals, tabs, and skill rows.

### 7. Animation & Effects

- Smooth transitions for tab changes, modal open/close, stat bar updates.
- Tap feedback and animated icons for interactive elements.
- Optional: Add toggleable sound effects for actions like save/delete.

### 8. Implementation Steps

1. Add Google Fonts import for "M PLUS Rounded 1c" in HTML head.
2. Define base color palette with CSS variables for stat, accent, and character-motif colors.
3. Build reusable components: stat bar, skill card, plan card, dialog/modal, sidebar menu.
4. Apply gradient backgrounds, drop shadows, rounded corners, and animated transitions.
5. Integrate tap feedback and animation logic in JS.
6. Ensure accessibility (contrast, keyboard, ARIA, reduced-motion).
7. Optionally add audio cues for key actions.
8. Use a data-first approach: group/categorize information before UI layout.
9. Test for mobile usability and thumb reach.
